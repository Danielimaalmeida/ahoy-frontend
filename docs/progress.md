# Ahoy frontend · progress

**Updated 2026-10-06 by lane 2A (API client), committed and pushed with the user's approval to branch
`claude/charming-clarke-tlb24e` (from `main` at 132728f; no PR yet). State: phase 0 is in `main` (PR #1). Lane 2A is built and
tested but NOT finished: the three dev dependencies it is approved to add (`openapi-typescript`, `ajv`, `yaml`, plan §10) could not
be installed, so the generated types, `api:types`, `api:check` and `contract.spec.ts` are missing.**

- **Ran (offline, 0 AIU, Node 24.21.0 via `npx node@24`):** `npm run build`, `npm run typecheck` (`check-boundaries: ok`),
  `npm run lint`, `npm test` (13 files, **499 tests**: 15 of phase 0 and 484 of lane 2A), Prettier on everything this lane
  touched; `npm start` in headless Chromium (the app boots with the new initializer and interceptor); the client over
  Angular's real `fetch` backend with a fake `fetch`; five mutation checks of the tests.
- **Did not run:** `scripts/smoke-api.mjs` and `scripts/capture-fixtures.mjs` (written, only syntax-checked: they need a
  local API, as the lane says); anything against the `ahoy-hosted` API (no Docker daemon, no Postgres server); `api:types`,
  `api:check`, `contract.spec.ts` (not delivered); the CI workflow (nothing pushed).
- **Red, and not from this lane:** `npm run format:check` on the whole repository fails on 24 skill files under
  `.agents/skills`, `.github/skills` and `.opencode/skills`, which came in `main` with commit 132728f ("Added skills").
  Everything this lane touched passes it. See "Needs from other lanes".

## Where we are

Phase 0 is in `main`. Lane 2A (wave 1) delivers the data layer's client side: `ApiClient` with the 19 operations of phases 3
to 6, `ApiError` and its predicates, the manual guards, `parseRunProgress`, `readStoryState`, the `AuthStrategy` seam, `CurrentUser`,
the runtime `AppConfig` (and `API_BASE` taken from it), the fixtures and the vendored contract. It is waiting on one
approval to be complete (see "Start here next"). Lanes 1A and 2C of wave 1 are independent of it. No screen exists yet and
no call has ever reached a real API (risk R1 is still open).

## Start here next

1. **User, to finish lane 2A:** approve installing `openapi-typescript@7.13.0`, `ajv@8.20.0` and `yaml@2.9.1` as dev
   dependencies (all three are on the approved list in plan §10; versions from `npm view` on 2026-10-06). A permission
   classifier blocked `npm install` in the session that did lane 2A, so give the approval in a session that is allowed to
   run it (or allow `npm install` for it), or run
   `npm install --save-dev openapi-typescript@7.13.0 ajv@8.20.0 yaml@2.9.1` yourself. Expect npm to refuse, because
   `openapi-typescript@7.13.0` declares the peer `typescript ^5.x` and the project is on `~6.0.3`; the fix is an `overrides`
   entry in `package.json` (`"openapi-typescript": { "typescript": "$typescript" }`), and whether the generator works on
   TypeScript 6 is not yet known. The steps that follow are under "Not done" in the lane 2A section.
2. **User:** review the lane 2A commit on `claude/charming-clarke-tlb24e` and decide on a PR into `main` (none was opened).
   The one edit outside the lane's directories is `src/app/app.config.ts` (see "Decisions and deviations", 2).
3. **User:** make the cloud environment's setup script install Node 24 (sessions still start on Node 22.22.0, which
   Angular 22 rejects). Until then each agent must put `npx node@24` first on its `PATH` (see "Prompt for a new
   session").
4. **User:** decide what to do with the 24 unformatted skill files (add them to `.prettierignore`, or `prettier --write`
   them), so that `npm run format:check` is green again on `main`.
5. **Wave 1**, in parallel, one branch per lane from `main`: **1A** (kit foundation) and **2C** (pure domain) are still to
   do; **6D** is optional. Prompts are in `docs/paralelos1.md`. Lanes 2B and 2D (wave 2) need 2A _and_ 2C in `main`. Finish 2A
   first: 2D reuses the Ajv helper that comes with `contract.spec.ts`.
6. Optional, whenever a session has Docker and Postgres: run `npm run dev -- --simulate` in `ahoy-hosted`, then `npm start`
   here, then `node scripts/smoke-api.mjs --confirm-simulate`, and `node scripts/capture-fixtures.mjs --confirm-simulate`
   after driving a story through the simulation. That is the first time the client would meet a real API, and it would
   confirm the `state.json` field names `readStoryState` reads. Also `curl -s localhost:4200/api/v1/health` and
   `curl -N localhost:4200/api/v1/events/stream` for the proxy (phase 0's open item).

## Prompt for a new session

> Read `CLAUDE.md`, `docs/progress.md`, `docs/plan/00-overview.md` and `docs/plan/<phase>.md`. Implement **only** lane
> `<id>`; follow the protocol in §9 of the overview. First run `node -v`: if it is below 22.22.3, run `npx -y node@24 -v`
> and put that binary first on your `PATH` for every command (see "Node in cloud sessions" below). Don't commit or push.
> Finish with your lane's report in `docs/progress.md`.

To finish lane 2A after the dependencies are approved:

> Read `CLAUDE.md`, `docs/progress.md` (the lane 2A section, "Not done") and `docs/plan/phase-2-data-layer.md`. Finish
> **only** lane 2A: install the three approved dev dependencies at the versions in the report, generate `schema.d.ts`, add
> `api:types` and `api:check`, switch `core/api/types.ts` to the generated types, add `contract.spec.ts` with the mirror of
> the contract as the report describes it, and update the lane section. Don't commit or push.

## Lane P0 · Foundation (2026-10-06)

Committed and pushed to `ccr-be69922d-w5i04m` with the user's approval.

### Node in cloud sessions (0.1)

- `node -v` was **v22.22.0**, below Angular 22's `^22.22.3 || ^24.15.0 || >=26.0.0`. `npx -y node@24 -v` gave
  **v24.21.0**. The binary from the npx cache was copied into the session scratchpad and put first on `PATH`; npm
  10.9.4 (the system one) ran under it. Every command below ran on Node 24.21.0.
- **The environment's setup script must install Node 24** so sessions don't depend on this workaround (the plan's
  `npm install -g node@24` is still untested).
- `.nvmrc` = `24`; `package.json` `engines.node` = `^22.22.3 || ^24.15.0 || >=26.0.0` (Angular 22's range).

### Proof

All on Node 24.21.0, offline, 0 AIU.

- **Acceptance chain:** `npm ci && npm run build && npm run typecheck && npm run lint && npm test && npm run format:check`
  green (see "Final check" below for the exact output).
- **Tests:** 1 file, **15 tests** (`src/app/app.routes.spec.ts`): each of the 14 URLs (13 routes of §5.3, one with query
  parameters, plus `**`) shows its placeholder, its lane and its document title; `/voyages/PROJ-123` redirects to
  `/voyages/PROJ-123/plan` and the shell receives the key. `/_kit` is not in the unit tests (its presence depends on the
  build configuration); it was checked in the browser and in the build output instead.
- **`npm start`:** served on `localhost:4200`; headless Chromium (`--dump-dom`) rendered `/`, `/voyages`,
  `/voyages/new`, `/docks`, `/voyages/PROJ-123` (→ Plan), `/voyages/PROJ-123/models`, `/voyages/PROJ-123/runs/r-02`
  and `/_kit`, each with its placeholder and title.
- **`/_kit` only in dev:** `ng build --configuration development` and `--configuration mock` emit a `kit-routes` chunk;
  the production build does not, and `grep` finds no `_kit` or `Kit · Ahoy` in `dist/ahoy-frontend/`.
- **Boundaries:** with three throw-away files (since removed), `check-boundaries` reported 7 violations and exited 1:
  `ui` → `@core/api/api-base` and → `../../core/realtime/fetch`; `domain` → `@angular/core` and → `@ui/...`; feature
  `docks` → `@features/harbour/...` (re-export) and → `../voyages/...` (dynamic import); a feature → `@testing/...`.
  After removal: `check-boundaries: ok`.
- **TypeScript flags:** a throw-away `domain/` file (since removed) made `tsc -p tsconfig.app.json` fail with TS2375
  (`exactOptionalPropertyTypes`), TS2322 (`noUncheckedIndexedAccess`), TS2366 (`noImplicitReturns`), TS4114
  (`noImplicitOverride`), TS4111 (`noPropertyAccessFromIndexSignature`) and TS1484 (`verbatimModuleSyntax`).
- **ESLint rules:** throw-away files (since removed) were rejected for `@ts-ignore`, `any`, `enum`, `namespace`,
  `as unknown as`, `export default`, a non-`ah` selector, `ChangeDetectionStrategy.Eager`, `<img>` without `alt`, and a
  `(click)` on a `<div>` without keyboard handler or focus (12 errors).
- **Proxy, against a stub only:** with `npm start` running and a throw-away Node server on `127.0.0.1:8080` (not the
  Ahoy API; it echoed headers and sent one SSE event per second):
  - `curl -s localhost:4200/api/v1/health` reached the stub with `X-Ahoy-Actor: dev@example.com`, no `Authorization`,
    and `Host: 127.0.0.1:8080` (`changeOrigin`);
  - `curl -N localhost:4200/api/v1/events/stream` delivered events at 1.01 s, 2.02 s, 3.02 s and 4.02 s: **no
    buffering** through the dev-server proxy (risk R4, for the dev server only; the Ingress is not tested);
  - with nothing on 8080 the proxy answered `502` (`ECONNREFUSED`).
- **No secrets:** no token, `.env` or `.local/` in the tree; `.gitignore` now ignores `.env`, `.env.*`, `/.local` and
  `/.work`.

### Did not run, skipped, and why

- **Proxy against `ahoy-hosted`:** not run. The session has the Docker CLI but no daemon (`/var/run/docker.sock`
  missing) and no Postgres server, which the hosted API needs; the hosted repository was not cloned. Only the stub
  check above ran.
- **CI on GitHub:** the workflow was not run (nothing pushed).
- **Wireframes in a browser:** not opened. They reference `./support.js` (the Claude Design runtime), which the artifact
  does not publish; see `docs/design/SOURCES.md`.
- **`tokens.css`:** not in the artifacts; lane 1A generates it.
- **Skipped test suites:** none. Template type-checking is covered by `ng build`, not by `npm run typecheck`.

Notes:

- **TypeScript:** npm `latest` is 7.0.2, but `@angular/build` 22.2.1 requires `>=6.0 <6.1` and `typescript-eslint`
  8.71.1 `<6.1.0`, so 6.0.3 (the newest 6.0) is installed with `~` instead of `^`. This is the one dev dependency not
  on `^`; `CLAUDE.md` says so.
- **Not installed** (approved, but for later lanes): `@angular/cdk` (1C), `marked` (1C), `diff` (2C),
  `openapi-typescript` (2A), `ajv` and `yaml` (2A, 2D), `@playwright/test` and `@axe-core/playwright` (6B, 6C).
- No `zone.js` (zoneless) and no `@eslint/js` (not on the list; ESLint's core recommended rules are therefore not
  enabled, only typescript-eslint's and angular-eslint's).

### Decisions and deviations from the plan

- `<ah-root class="ah">` instead of `<app-root class="ah">`: the component prefix is `ah`.
- A `**` route with a "Not found" placeholder for lane 6A (not in §5.3).
- `/voyages/:key` redirects to `plan` until lane 4A adds the status-based default tab.
- The run detail is a top-level route (before `voyages/:key`), not a child of the voyage shell.
- `API_BASE` lives in `core/api/api-base.ts` (lane 2A owns it), `FETCH` in `core/realtime/fetch.ts` (2B), `AppConfig`
  and the no-op `initAppConfig` in `core/config/app-config.ts` (2A).
- The shared placeholder `ah-placeholder` is in `src/app/ui/placeholder/` (owned by P0; lane 6A removes it).
- `start:mock` uses the `mock` configuration, which until lane 2D is a copy of `development` (same environment file).
- The scaffold's `app.spec.ts` (it checked the demo page) was replaced by `app.routes.spec.ts`.
- The scaffold's `.editorconfig` set `quote_type = single` for `.ts`, and Prettier 3 reads it: the first format pass
  produced single quotes. Fixed to `double`, and `.prettierrc.json` now sets `"singleQuote": false` explicitly so the
  editor config can't override the hosted style again.
- Full detail in `docs/architecture.md`.

### Needs from other lanes

- **From the user:** merge of phase 0 into `main`; Node 24 in the environment's
  setup script.
- **For lane 1A:** `src/styles.scss` and `src/styles/` are empty; `index.html` has no fonts or icon yet (the bundle
  imports Google Fonts, decision §12 q4). `src/app/ui/_kit/kit.routes.ts` is a placeholder to replace.
- **For lane 2A:** fill `initAppConfig` (`/config.json`) and decide whether `API_BASE` comes from `AppConfig.apiBase`.
- **For lane 2D:** add `src/environments/environment.mock.ts` and point the `mock` configuration's `fileReplacements`
  at it (it may import `src/testing/`; `check-boundaries` already allows that one file and `src/app/core/mock/`).
- **For lane 2D (decided by the user on 2026-10-06):** no `json-server`. The same `MockAhoyServer` also runs as an HTTP
  server through a dependency-free `node:http` adapter (`npm run mock:api` on `127.0.0.1:8080`), so `npm start` can use
  it through the real proxy. Added to deliverable 9 and the acceptance of lane 2D in `docs/plan/phase-2-data-layer.md`.

### Final check

Run at the end of the lane, on Node 24.21.0, after `npm ci` (the five `npm run` steps were repeated after the quote
fix above, with the same results):

```
$ node -v                     v24.21.0
$ npm ci                      exit 0 (383 packages)
$ npm run build               exit 0 (production bundle, 13 lazy chunks, no kit-routes)
$ npm run typecheck           exit 0 (tsc app + spec; check-boundaries: ok)

## Lane 2A · API client (2026-10-06)

**Built and tested, not finished.** The lane may add `openapi-typescript`, `ajv` and `yaml` (plan §10). The session's
permission classifier denied the `npm install` of them ("Untrusted Code Integration") and the lane did not try another way
round it: no `npx`, no hand-edited `package.json`, no use of the copies of `ajv` and `yaml` that other packages bring in
`node_modules`. Everything that does not need them is done and verified; what is left is under "Not done".

One commit on branch `claude/charming-clarke-tlb24e`, from `main` at 132728f, pushed after the user approved it in the session
(CLAUDE.md requires that approval; the environment's stop hook had only asked for a push). No PR. The contract was read from
`Danielimaalmeida/ahoy-hosted` at commit `1890d5aa84819480275f79060cae5d529be21ee8` (read-only; the repository was attached to
the session and cloned outside this one).

No request carries `Authorization`.                                                                                                        |

| 8   | `smoke-api.mjs`, `capture-fixtures.mjs` | written, **not run** | `scripts/`. Both refuse any host but this machine, need `--confirm-simulate`, never send `Authorization`, and `capture-fixtures` only does GETs. Output of the capture goes to `src/testing/fixtures/captured/`, which a `.gitignore` keeps out of git until reviewed. |

The 19 methods: `getHealth`, `listStories`, `startStory`, `getStory`, `stopStory`, `resumeStory`, `setStoryBudget`,
`getStoryModels`, `setStoryModels`, `listStoryRuns`, `getRun`, `listQuestions`, `answerQuestion`, `listGateRecords`,
`decideHumanGate`, `getStoryState`, `listArtifacts`, `getArtifactContent`, `listStoryEvents`. The phase 7 operations and the
stream (2B) are not there, as the plan says.

### Not done (all of it needs the install)

1. `npm install --save-dev openapi-typescript@7.13.0 ajv@8.20.0 yaml@2.9.1` (exact versions from `npm view`, 2026-10-06; npm
   writes them with `^`, as CLAUDE.md wants for dev dependencies). `openapi-typescript@7.13.0` declares the peer
   `typescript ^5.x` and the project is on `~6.0.3`, so add `"overrides": { "openapi-typescript": { "typescript": "$typescript" } }`
   to `package.json`. **Not tested:** whether the generator works on TypeScript 6 (it uses the compiler API). If it does not, stop and ask.
2. Scripts `api:types` (`openapi-typescript openapi/ahoy-v1.yaml -o src/app/core/api/schema.d.ts --immutable`) and `api:check`
   (the same with `--check`; confirm the flag in 7.13.0, else regenerate to a temporary file and compare). `schema.d.ts` is already
   ignored by ESLint and Prettier.
3. In `core/api/types.ts`, turn each type into an alias of `components["schemas"][...]` and add type-level equality checks for
   the enum arrays (`STORY_STATUSES` and the others stay as runtime arrays). It is the only file that mentions the shape of the API.
4. `contract.spec.ts`. **How it has to read the YAML, from throw-away probes that were run and then removed:** a spec cannot
   read `openapi/ahoy-v1.yaml` itself. `node:fs` in a spec fails `tsc` and `ng test` (TS2591: `@types/node` is not installed, and
   is not on the approved list); a TypeScript import of a file outside `src/` fails `check-boundaries` ("imports from outside
   src/"); a `?raw` import fails too (TS2307, and the Angular build). A JSON import works (the fixtures prove it). Untested: a
   `loader` entry for `.yaml` in `angular.json`, which this lane does not own. So: let `sync-openapi.mjs` also write
   `src/testing/fixtures/openapi.json` (the YAML parsed with `yaml`), make `api:check` verify that this mirror still equals the YAML, and let
   the spec import the JSON and validate with `Ajv2020` from `ajv/dist/2020`, `{ strict: false, allErrors: true }`,
   `ajv.addSchema({ $id: "ahoy", components })` and the `#/components/` to `ahoy#/components/` rewrite that the hosted server's own
   `loadContract` and `wrap` use. `ajv-formats` is not on the approved list, so register `date-time` by hand with
   `ajv.addFormat`. What it must check: every fixture against the success response of its operation, every entry of
   `problems.json` against `Problem`, the request bodies of the `ApiClient` spec against the request schemas, and that the enum arrays of
   `types.ts` equal the YAML's. Put the Ajv helper in `src/testing/fixtures/` so that lane 2D can reuse it ("as 2A does").
5. Update this section and the README line, and run the whole chain again.

### Proof

All on Node 24.21.0, offline, 0 AIU.

- **Chain:** `npm run build`, `npm run typecheck` (`tsc` app and spec, then `check-boundaries: ok`), `npm run lint`,
  `npm test`, all exit 0. `npx prettier --check scripts/ openapi/ src/ package.json`: all files pass.
- **Tests:** 13 files, **499 tests, 0 failed, 0 skipped** (15 of phase 0). New:

- **Mutation checks:** five deliberate breaks of the production code were each caught, then restored (all 499 green again):
  AIU guard accepting fractions (6 tests failed), interceptor adding headers to every URL (6), client without the 304 branch (1),
  form paths ignoring the `body/` prefix (4), config accepting any `apiBase` (13).
- **Real browser:** `npm start`, then headless Chromium on `/`, `/voyages` and `/voyages/PROJ-123/plan`: each rendered its placeholder
  and title, so the app boots with the new initializer and the interceptor registered. The dev server answers `/config.json` with a
  404, so the app ran on the defaults, and the page logged no warning or error.
- **`sync-openapi.mjs`:** ran against the local clone; the body is identical to the hosted file, re-syncing from the vendored copy
  changes nothing, and it refuses a file outside a git checkout without `--commit`, a file that is not OpenAPI 3.1, a missing file,
  an `http:` URL and a malformed `--commit`.

### Did not run, skipped, and why

- **`scripts/smoke-api.mjs` and `scripts/capture-fixtures.mjs`:** not run, as the lane says (they need a local API). Checked with
  `node --check` only, so their logic, including the refusal of a non-local host, has not been exercised.
- **Nothing ran against the `ahoy-hosted` API.** This session has the `docker` and `psql` clients but no Docker daemon and no
  Postgres server. So the client has still never met a real API (risk R1 stays open), and the `state.json` field names that
  `readStoryState` reads (`acceptance_criteria`, `work_packages`, `human_gates`, `revisions`, `revision_ceiling`, and inside
  them `depends_on`, `open_pr`, `timestamp`) were **confirmed from the hosted renderer** (`encodeStory` in
  `packages/core/src/domain/story-document.ts` and its e2e test at 1890d5a), **not from a live `--simulate` answer**.
- **`api:types`, `api:check`, `contract.spec.ts`:** not delivered (see "Not done"). Consequently "`api:check` limpo" and
  "`contract.spec.ts` verde" of the acceptance criteria are **not met**.
- **`sync-openapi.mjs` with an https URL:** not run (only local paths).
- **CI on GitHub:** not run (nothing pushed).
- **`npm run format:check` on the whole repository:** red, from the 24 skill files named above. It was red on `main` before this
  lane and the lane did not touch them.
- **Skipped test suites:** none.

### Decisions and deviations

1. **The wire types are hand-written** in `core/api/types.ts` until `schema.d.ts` can be generated, written to mirror the
   YAML field by field. `Shape<T>` in the guard kit makes a guard that forgets, or invents, a field of its type fail to compile.
2. **`API_BASE` now comes from `AppConfig.apiBase`** (the lane asked for a decision). `/config.json` can say
   `"apiBase": "/some/prefix/api/v1"`; the value is accepted only if it is a path on this origin (one leading `/`, no scheme or host,
   no `.` or `..` segment), else the default `/api/v1` is used and one warning is logged. F9 (same origin) still holds. To make it
   work, **`src/app/app.config.ts` was edited, outside the directories this lane owns:** it registers
   `withInterceptors([authInterceptor])` on `provideHttpClient(withFetch())` and no longer provides `API_BASE` itself (the token has
   a default that reads the config). Nothing else there changed. Without that edit neither the interceptor nor the decision would
   take effect.
3. **Guards are strict about the contract's closed enums** (`status`, run status, outcomes, slots, sources, efforts) and about
   patterns and AIU amounts, and tolerant about what the contract leaves open: `phase`, `haltReason`, `agent`, `runtime`, the event
   `type` and, for errors, the problem `code`. Extra fields are always tolerated. A status the vendored contract does not list
   makes the answer an `invalid_response` that names it, which is the signal to re-sync the contract.
4. **How an answer becomes an `ApiError`:** `status` 0 (offline, refused, aborted, **timed out**) is `{ kind: "network" }`; a
   502, 503 or 504 without problem details (a gateway page, the dev proxy with no API behind it) is `{ kind: "network", status }`
   (the optional `status` is an addition to the plan's `{ kind: "network" }`); any other error status without problem details is
   `invalid_response` (`getX: HTTP 401 without problem details`); a 2xx that is not JSON, a wrong shape and anything thrown inside the
   pipeline (an `AuthStrategy` that rejects) are `invalid_response` too. The problem's `status` is the HTTP status of the answer, and its
   `type` is not kept.
5. **Every request has a 30 s timeout** (`REQUEST_TIMEOUT_MS`), and the start-up read of `/config.json` 5 s, so a hung request
   becomes a network failure instead of a screen that spins for ever. Not in the plan; easy to change.
6. **Return shapes:** the three plain lists give an array (`listStoryRuns`, `listQuestions`, `listGateRecords` unwrap `items`);
   `listStories`, `listArtifacts` and `listStoryEvents` keep their envelope (`nextCursor`, `revision`, `lastEventId`);
   `getArtifactContent` gives `{ kind: "content", text, etag, mediaType }` or `{ kind: "not_modified" }` for a 304;
   `getStoryState` gives `state` as `Readonly<Record<string, unknown>>` (an object, checked), a refinement of the plan's `unknown`.
7. **`readStoryState`** gives maps (`humanGates`, `revisions`), applies the hosted default ceiling of 4 when the state sets none, reads an
   unset package status as `pending` (as the hosted code does) and never throws.
8. **`AuthStrategy`** is called per request by `authInterceptor` and only for URLs under `API_BASE`; `NoAuthStrategy` returns `{}`.
   The event stream (2B) must call `AUTH_STRATEGY` itself because it uses `fetch`.
9. **`CurrentUser`** has the signals `id` and `initials`, and `is(actor)`. Initials: the e-mail's local part as words, first letters of
   the first two (`alex.rivera@` gives `AR`), or the first two letters of a single word (`alex@` gives `AL`, as in the design system).
10. **Fixtures:** named by operation id. The text of an artifact is `getArtifactContent.json`
    (`{ path, mediaType, etag, text }`, the ETag being the quoted sha256 that `listArtifacts` lists for it) because a markdown file
    cannot be imported by a spec. `src/testing/fixtures/mutate.ts` breaks a fixture one field at a time for the guard tests. All data is
    fictional, from the wireframes (PROJ-123, alex@example.com). The `.gitkeep` files of `core/auth` and `testing/fixtures` were removed.
11. **`package.json`:** only the `api:sync` script was added. No dependency.
12. **`ahoy-hosted`'s own `CLAUDE.md` was not loaded:** it still holds the `node:test` and `NodeNext` conventions that plan §4 replaced.

### What the real API does that the plan did not say

From the hosted sources at 1890d5a (`apps/api/src/server.ts`, `packages/core`), not from a live answer:

- **`errors[].path` has two forms.** The contract check writes `body/budgetNanoAiu`, `body` (the whole body) and `query.limit`; the
  story's own rules write JSON pointers such as `/reason`, `/models` and `/models/review-defect`. `formControlPath` reads both.
- **A problem never has `instance`**, its `title` is the code with spaces (`stale version`, not display text) and its `type` is
  `urn:ahoy:problem:<code>`. So the "request id" of the plan's "Lost contact with the harbour" pattern is empty today.
- **Timestamps** are `toISOString()`, with milliseconds. `Date.parse` accepts 30 February, so the timestamp guard says "an RFC 3339
  date-time `Date` can read", no more.
- **An artifact's content** comes with the stored media type (no charset) and `ETag: "<sha256>"`; a 304 has no body.
- **A send-back deletes the gate's entry in `human_gates`** and counts the round in `revisions[<gate>]`; an approve or reject writes
  `status` there (`approved` is what the hosted e2e test checks). So the plan's "round x of 4" is `revisions[gate] + 1`, and the next
  send-back after the ceiling answers `revision_ceiling_reached`.
- **`lastEventId`** of `listStoryEvents` is null only when there is no event and no `after`; with `after` and nothing new it echoes `after`.

### Needs from other lanes

- **From the user:** the approval to install the three dev dependencies; approval to commit and push; the decision on the 24
  unformatted skill files; Node 24 in the setup script (still open from phase 0).
- **For lane 2C:** `check-boundaries` forbids `domain/` importing `@core`, so the plan's "re-export the types of `schema.d.ts`" cannot be
  done as written. Either `domain/` keeps its own structurally identical types (the types in `core/api/types.ts` are assignable to
  them, and the guards return those), or the boundary rule is relaxed for a type-only import. The names and shapes `core/api` exports:
  `Story`, `StoryPage`, `Run`, `Question`, `GateRecord`, `Artifact`, `AhoyEvent`, `ModelPlan`, `SlotModel`, `ModelChoice`, `Usage`,
  `GateVerdict`, and the unions `StoryStatus`, `RunStatus`, `GateOutcome`, `ModelSlot`, `ReasoningEffort`, `ModelSource`,
  `EffortSource`, with runtime arrays (`STORY_STATUSES`...). `DEFAULT_REVISION_CEILING` (4) is in `core/api/story-state.ts`.
- **For lane 2B:** inject `ApiClient`, `API_BASE` and `AUTH_STRATEGY` (the stream calls `headers()` itself); use `isEvent` and
  `parseRunProgress(event.payload)` for `run.progress`; `listStoryEvents` gives `lastEventId` for `after`. `FETCH` and
  `core/realtime/` are untouched.
- **For lane 2D:** the fixtures in `src/testing/fixtures/` are shaped like the real answers and can seed the mock. The mock should
  answer errors the way the real API does (`type: "urn:ahoy:problem:<code>"`, `title` the code with spaces, `errors[].path` in both
  forms, `currentVersion` on `stale_version`). The Ajv helper for conformance tests will be in `src/testing/fixtures/` when
  `contract.spec.ts` is done (see "Not done", 4); until then do not write a second one.
- **For lane 4A:** `CommandRunner` can switch on `isStale`, `isDecisionAlreadyRecorded`, `isAlreadyAnswered`, `isStoryExists`,
  `isInvalidState`, `isRevisionCeilingReached`, `isLegacyStory`, `isValidationFailed` (with `fieldErrors` for the form), `isNotFound`,
  `isUnauthenticated` and `isUnreachable` (network or `unavailable`); an `invalid_response` is never to be shown as a verdict.
- **For lane 3A and the voyage lanes:** `CurrentUser` (`id()`, `initials()`, `is(actor)`) and `readStoryState` for the plan screen.
- **For lane 6D:** `/config.json` takes `apiBase`, `actor` and `jiraBaseUrl` (all optional; `null` or missing means the default; an
  empty `jiraBaseUrl` means no Jira). `actor` must equal the `AHOY_ACTOR` of the dev proxy. Serve it with `Cache-Control: no-cache` and with a
  real 404 when there is none (the app also copes with an HTML page).
- **For the composition root and docs (P0, 6A):** the README "Commands" table has no row for `npm run api:sync` (this lane may only
  touch the Status line); `docs/architecture.md` still says `API_BASE` is provided by `app.config.ts`.

$ npm run lint                exit 0 (no problems)
$ npm test                    exit 0 (Test Files 13 passed (13); Tests 499 passed (499))
$ npx prettier --check scripts/ openapi/ src/ package.json   exit 0 (all files use Prettier code style)
$ npm run format:check        exit 1 (24 files, all under .agents/skills, .github/skills and .opencode/skills; none is from this lane)
```
